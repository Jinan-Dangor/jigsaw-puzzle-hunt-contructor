# Jigsaw, the Puzzle Hunt Site Contructor
Jigsaw Puzzle Hunt Constructor allows you to build static puzzle hunt websites that mimic the behaviour of live hunts.

To make a hunt, fork this repository, then build up your hunt according to the documentation.
Then copy the contents of the hunt_deployment folder into a new repo, and host it with github pages.

Note: Do not apply attributes directly to jigsaw-element tags, these tags have attributes modified through code which may conflict with provided attributes.
Instead, apply attributes to a div outside the tag, or otherwise.
