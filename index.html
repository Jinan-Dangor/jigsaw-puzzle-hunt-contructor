<h1>Access Your Hunt</h1>
<p>
    This page won't show up on your real hunt, because only items in the /hunt_deployment/ directory will get copied.
    This page exists so you can test your site before deployment. The link below leads to the landing page your users will see.
    I'd recommend not editting this page, because if it doesn't send you to your hunt when you click the link below you know you're missing an index.
